### Get list of games for a given date/range and/or team/opponent.

`statsapi.schedule(date=None, start_date=None, end_date=None, team="", opponent="", sportId=1, game_id=None)`

Output will be a list containing a dict for each game. Fields in the dict:

`game_id`: unique MLB game id (primary key, or gamePk)

`game_date`: date of game (`YYYY-MM-DD`)
`game_type`: Preseason, Regular season, Postseason, etc. Look up possible values using the meta endpoint with type=gameTypes

`home_name`: team name for the home team (e.g. `Philadelphia Phillies`)

`doubleheader`: indicates if the game is part of a straight doubleheader (`Y`), a split doubleheader (`S`), or not part of a doubleheader (`N`)

`current_inning`: current inning (applies best to in-progress games)

## Example

`games = statsapi.schedule(start_date='07/01/2018',end_date='07/31/2018',team=143,opponent=121)`

Print a list of those games with final score or game status:

```python
for x in games:
    print(x['summary'])
```

### Output

2018-07-09 - Philadelphia Phillies (3) @ New York Mets (1) (Final)

```python
for x in games:
    print("%s Game %s - WP: %s, LP: %s" % (x['game_date'],x['game_num'],x['winning_pitcher'],x['losing_pitcher']))
```

### Output
