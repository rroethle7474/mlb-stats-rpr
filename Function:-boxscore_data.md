## Returns a python dict containing boxscore data for a given game.

> *Note*: To retrieve a formatted text version of the box score, see [Function: boxscore](https://github.com/toddrob99/MLB-StatsAPI/wiki/Function:-boxscore).

> *Note*: This function uses the game endpoint instead of game_box, because game_box does not contain the players' names as they should be displayed in the box score (e.g. Last name only or Last, F)

It is possible to get the boxscore as it existed at a specific time by including the timestamp in the timecode parameter.
The timecode should be in the format YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS, and in the UTC timezone
For example, 4/24/19 10:32:40 EDT (-4) would be: 20190425_012240
A list of timestamps for game events can be found through the game_timestamps endpoint:
statsapi.get('game_timestamps',{'gamePk':565997})
